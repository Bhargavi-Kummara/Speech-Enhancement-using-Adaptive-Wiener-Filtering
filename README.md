# Speech-Enhancement-using-Adaptive-Wiener-Filtering

#### The objective of this project was to improve the intelligibility of speech that has been degraded by additive noise, specifically additive white gaussian noise. Implemented it using the Adaptive Wiener Filtering Technique in MATLAB, which resulted in a substantial increase in the SNR ratio.
